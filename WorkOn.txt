Work on:

 - Weight averaging for DNN: Look at TIC and generalization bounds (prove that it generalizes better)

 - Link to latent data models: Do averaging on Bayesian Neural Networks: see if mode connectivity on the hyper parameters as well and if good generalization

 - derive new methods based on the curvature of the loss landscapes in neural net: maybe use the TIC information criteria to find good minima

- Continue R package SAEMIX
