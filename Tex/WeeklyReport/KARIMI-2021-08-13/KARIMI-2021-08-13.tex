\title{Weekly Report KARIMI 2021-08-06}


\date{}
\maketitle

\vspace{-0.5in}

My work this week has mainly been towards making progress STANLey AAAI 2022 paper and NeurIPS rebuttals.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Experiments and Redaction for STANLey paper.
\item Reviews for NeurIPS papers (some of them need two sets of reviews).
\end{enumerate}



\section{STANLey paper}

For the STANLey project, I have made improvements on the overleaf paper and point you to the paper itself to see the substantial progress.
In short, I have made sure we present three types of experiments: 1) toy case (Mixture model retrieval), 2) Image generation (FID and visual for CIFAR and Flowers) and 3) Image inpaintings (FID for Celeb done, need to do visual check for the baselines (running now)).
AAAI template has been used on overleaf for the next month deadline.

\textcolor{purple}{Please refer to the paper on overleaf as most of the improvements are there}.

\textbf{TODO:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Finish writing and including ICCV reviews in the redaction.
\item Several sets of inpaintings for CelebA dataset for two baselines (HMC and vanilla Langevin). Only visual check since FID is done.
\item Sets of inpaintings for CIFAR or Flowers datasets for our method and two baseliens. Only visual check since FID is done.
\end{itemize}



\section{NeurIPS 2021 Reviews}

I have been working on drafts of the rebuttals.
Two of our papers have two sets of reviews making it more work overall.


\textcolor{purple}{Please refer to the overleaf projects of each paper to check the progress on the rebuttals.}
