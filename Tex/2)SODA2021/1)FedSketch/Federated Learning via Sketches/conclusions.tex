\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \texttt{FedSKETCH} and \texttt{FedSKETCHGATE} algorithms for homogeneous and heterogeneous data distribution setting respectively for Federated Learning wherein communication between server and devices is only performed using count sketch. 
Our algorithms, thus, provide communication-efficiency and privacy. 
We analyze the convergence error for \emph{non-convex}, \emph{\pl} and \emph{general convex} objective functions in the scope of Federated Optimization.  
We provide insightful numerical experiments showcasing the advantages of our FedSketch and FedSketchGATE methods over current federated optimization algorithm.
