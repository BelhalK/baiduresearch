\noindent\textit{Motion planning Problem description}: Let there be an environment of $\mathbb{R}^d$ where $d = 2$ or $3$; obstacles $\mathcal{O}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$, $i = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, a robot of geometry $\mathcal{B}$, denote the configuration of the robot as $q\in\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n$ is the number of Degree of Freedom (DoF) of the robot. Let the robot has controls $u\in\mathcal{U}$, and let there be start $s\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and goal $g\in\mathbb{R}^n$; find a sequence of robot configurations or a sequence of controls so that the robot can go from $s$ to $g$. We can assume there is an oracle function $\mathcal{F}:(q\times \cup\mathcal{O})\rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ that can return collision detection result in a given environment for any given configuration of the robot. 

One common approach is called sampling based motion planning, which is achieved through placing samples in $\mathcal{R}^n$, the configuration space, and retain valid non-collision samples in the configuration space by inquiring $\mathcal{F}$. The invalid samples are discarded (or retained in some cases), and the valid samples are connected if the path connecting the configurations is valid (pass the validity check after inquiring $\mathcal{F}$). A good set of samples will lead to solutions much faster compared to random samples, though may not always be optimal. 

If we want to use a learning method to create the samples, with bias, we may be able to find paths faster.
